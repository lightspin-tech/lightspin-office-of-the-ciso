# Lightspin Office of the CISO - Public Artifacts

Public artifacts from blogs and other collateral created by the Lightspin Office of the CISO

## What is this :eyes: :eyes: ??

This repository will contain any public releases (unless otherwise noted) produced by the Lightspin Office of the CISO, which includes but not limited too...

- Snippets from Blog Posts
- CloudFormation and Terraform templates
- Open-sourced Python and Bash scripts
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) lists

The directory structure will roughly be organized by the contents such as the `blogs/` directory containing sub-directories titled after the upstream Blog Post, and the `iocs/` directory containing IOC plaintext and CSV lists, and so on.
